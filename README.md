## PLEASE READ: Week 2 Homework 1
* I have recorded a short video that I'd like you to watch that will help you do the required homework
  * there are 3 problems on the homework, the first one you already know how to do because it exercises last week's material
  * the video will help you learn the topics needed for the other 2 problems in the homework
  * we will also cover these topics in class tomorrow, but if everyone watches the video, we'll likely be able to move through the material faster

## Who to contact to resolve issues
* Hi all, I know that some of you have faced some technical issues with BrightSpace and the Pluralsight platform and I'm sorry to hear about these issues!
   * I have no visibility into BrightSpace or the Pluralsight setup, so your first communication should be to your Year Up Project Manager. If they are unable to solve the issue, please reach out to
      * Sabrina Freytag  sabrina-freytag@pluralsight.com
      * Emilie Jones     emilie-jones@pluralsight.com
* I have made the YU folks aware of the fact that we are behind. I take responsibility for that. As a result, the assessment covers materials we haven't yet learned, which I know is frustrating. If you gave it a shot, that's fine. At this point it's more about attempting the work, rather than necessarily getting everything correct. 

## Instructor: Dave Wade-Stein
* dave@developintelligence.com
* PLEASE NOTE: I do not have any access or visibility to BrightSpace. So please reach out to your YU program manager with any issues that occur on that platform.
* your instructor for the remainder of the program will be Maaike van Putten (she is awesome!)

## You agree to the following...
* if you use AI, USE AI – do not stop until you understand (reframe, ask another question)
* DO NOT just click run in a notebook w/o having an idea of what the result will be

## Things to keep in mind to get better at coding...
* when you have a working solution, thing of another way to do it
* read code! You read code 10x more than you write code, develop that skill
* "Programs are written for others to read, and only incidentally for computers to execute" –Hal Abelson
* Eagleson's Law: "Any code you wrote more than six months ago might as well have been written by someone else"

## Resources
* AI (ChatGPT, Claude.AI, CoPilot, Bard, etc.)
  * if you're gonna use AI, then use AI (don't stop asking/reframing until you understand the answer)
  * remember that Colab has AI built-in
* [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/)

## Materials
